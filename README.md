# BCNet Tines Technical Workshop 2025
## Instructions and workflows for the BCNet Tines Technical Workshop 

I will lead a technical workshop at [BCNet Connect 2025](https://www.bc.net/connect), where you can gain hands-on experience with the [Tines automation platform](https://www.tines.com).

By the end of the workshop, you will know:

1. How to navigate the Tines User Interface.
2. How to configure Tines Resources and Tines Actions such Event Transformation and Trigger.
3. How to create a Tines webform to submit Indicators of Compromise for enrichment using Tines Pages.

**There is no prior technical, cybersecurity, or automation experience needed.**  

This workshop is not a lecture. 

It is hands-on keyboard, so bring your laptop!

We will co-build throughout the entire workshop, so you will understand how to construct a Tines workflow from start to finish.

In addition, you will learn how to leverage Tines AI Automatic Mode for Event Transformations and the Tines AI action.
