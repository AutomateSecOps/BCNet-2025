# BCNet Tines Technical Workshop 2025
Instructions and workflows for the BCNet Tines Technical Workshop 

[BCNet Connect 2025](https://www.bc.net/connect) will host a technical workshop, where you can gain hands-on experience with the [Tines automation platform](https://www.tines.com).

By the end of the workshop, you will know:

1. How to query the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) and transform data to create a csv report.
2. How to paginate amd collect all the results in an HTTP Request action.
3. How to create a Tines webform to submit Indicators of Compromise for enrichment.

**There is no prior technical or cybersecurity experience needed.**  

This workshop is not a lecture. 

It is hands-on keyboard, so bring your laptop!

We will co-build throughout the entire workshop, so you will understand how to construct a Tines workflow from start to finish, using different actions such as the Event Transformation, the Send Email, and Trigger action. 

In addition, you will learn how to leverage Tines AI Automatic Mode for Event Transformations and the Tines AI action.

## Requirements
- Sign up for the [FREE Tines Community Edition](https://www.tines.com/pricing/)
- Once signed into your Tines tenant, download and import the two Tines Stories under the [tines](tines) folder in this GitHub repo.

That's it.

Once you start automating, you can't stop!

Happy Building!

Tom
